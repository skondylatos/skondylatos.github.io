# About #

I am a researcher at [Orion Lab](https://orionlab.space.noa.gr), a joint research group of the National Observatory of Athens and the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. My work focuses on the application of deep learning techniques to Earth Observation.
I am currently nearing the completion of my PhD in _Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning for Earth Observation_ at the University of Valencia under the supervision of [Gustau Camps-Valls](https://www.uv.es/gcamps/) and [Ioannis Papoutsis](https://orionlab.space.noa.gr/author/ioannis-papoutsis/). 
I am also co-founder of [Manteo AI](https://manteo.ai), a chat-map assistant that simplifies access to Earth observation data and insights.

## Research ##


My research lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Uncertainty Quantification, and Earth Observation. Iâ€™m particularly motivated by the potential of AI to help address pressing environmental challenges, especially in areas like disaster management, natural hazards, and climate change. During my PhD, I worked on developing deep learning models for wildfire danger forecasting and explored uncertainty estimation in Earth observation deep learning models to improve their reliability and trustworthiness. I am also interested in broader Computer Vision topics, particularly representation learning and multi-modal models, and their application in Earth Observation for extracting deeper insights from satellite data.

## Background ##
I hold a BSc in Mathematics from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (2013), followed by an MSc in Applied Mathematics from the same institution (2016). I then completed a second MSc in Data Science at the Msc in Data Science from the Athens University of Economics and Business in 2017. From 2018 to 2020, I worked as a Data Scientist at [Omilia Conversational Intelligence](https://omilia.com), a company developing conversational AI systems, where I led the Data Science Team.
My main research projects there involved text data augmentation combining deep learning with rule-based methods, text clustering and classification with LSTMs and Transformers, and text representation learning with variational autoencoders.
